  <h1>Dettmer.dev</h1>
  <span class="badge">Full-Stack Dev / 3AM Server Fixer</span>
  <h2>hey</h2>
  <p>
    Developer and sysadmin who builds Discord bots, APIs, admin dashboards, and whatever else seems
    fun to implement. Started with simple automation scripts and somehow ended up running entire
    self-hosted infrastructures.
  </p>
  <p>
    Into self-hosted homelabs (because why pay for cloud when you can maintain servers at 3am?),
    Android custom ROMs and app development, game server hosting, mail servers that actually work,
    and web development with modern frameworks.
  </p>
  <p>
    Python + Flask is my go-to for backends. Keeps things simple and lets you move fast. Flutter
    when I need cross-platform UIs because writing the same app three times is not my idea of fun.
    Docker for deployment because "it works on my machine" stopped being an excuse years ago.
  </p>
  <p>
    This site? Built with Astro. Static site generator that doesn't try to be everything. Just does
    its job well.

  <h2>projects</h2>
  <p>
    Built Discord bots that actually do useful stuff, admin panels that don't make you want to cry,
    image galleries for personal use, and a bunch of self-hosted infrastructure that somehow stays
    running.
  </p>
  <p>
    Most projects start with "wouldn't it be cool if..." and end up being way more complex than
    initially planned. But that's half the fun.

  <h2>when i'm not staring at terminals</h2>
  <p>Family time is important. Can't spend all day in front of screens.</p>
  <p>
    When I actually leave the house: cycling, swimming, basketball. Turns out physical activity is
    good for you. Who knew.

  <h2>contact</h2>
  <p>
    Got a project idea? Need help with something? Just want to talk about self-hosted setups or why
    your mail server keeps ending up in spam? Send me an email. Always interested in interesting
    problems.
