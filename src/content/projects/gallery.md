Needed a place to dump screenshots and project images that looks better than a file explorer.
Also got tired of using imgur or random file hosts that either shut down randomly or start limiting uploads.

Built this personal image gallery where I can upload stuff and actually see it nicely organized. Simple concept but
way more useful than you'd think.

Has proper image optimization, lazy loading, responsive grid layout. The usual stuff you'd expect from a modern gallery
but done right. And since it's self-hosted, it won't disappear when some company decides to pivot their business model.

Can share direct links to specific images, browse through collections, organize everything into categories.
Basically a personal image host that doesn't look terrible.

## Features

- **Upload & management** - Drag and drop files, organize into collections. No complicated interfaces or confusing workflows
- **Responsive grid layout** - Adapts to any screen size. Looks good on phone, tablet, desktop, whatever
- **Image optimization** - Automatic compression and format conversion. Keeps everything fast without manual work
- **Lazy loading** - Only loads images when you scroll to them. Saves bandwidth, loads faster, just makes sense
- **Direct linking** - Every image gets its own URL. Easy sharing without uploading to third-party services
- **Collections** - Organize images into categories. Keeps things tidy instead of one giant mess

## Why This Exists

Honestly just wanted something I control that won't randomly shut down or start charging money.
Self-hosted means it stays up as long as my server does. And my server stays up because I actually maintain it.

## Tech

Modern web stack with proper image handling. Performance focused because nobody wants to wait 10 seconds for images to load.

Responsive design that works across all devices. Tested on everything from phone screens to ultrawide monitors.

Lightweight and fast. No bloated frameworks trying to do everything. Just clean, efficient code that does its job.

**Stack**: Modern web stack · Self-hosted · Optimized image handling · Responsive design
